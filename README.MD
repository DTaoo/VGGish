# VGGish: A VGG-like audio classification model 

This repository provides a VGGish model, implemented in Keras with tensorflow backend. This repository is developed 
based on the model for [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/index.html). 
For more details, please visit the [slim version](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset).

## Pretrained weights in Keras h5py:

They should be downloaded into `weights` directory

* [Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhqXZ8CANgHyepum7N4yrjiyIg6qaMe6) with the top fully connected layers

* [Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16JrWEedwaZFVZYvn1woPKCuWx85Ghzkp) without the top fully connected layers
