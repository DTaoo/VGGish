# Weigths folder
This folder  must contain weights for the VGGish keras model.

Let its original filenames as they are.


## Pretrained weights in Keras h5py:

* [Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhqXZ8CANgHyepum7N4yrjiyIg6qaMe6) with the top fully connected layers

* [Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16JrWEedwaZFVZYvn1woPKCuWx85Ghzkp) without the top fully connected layers

**TODO**: Add script to download them into appropriated folder
